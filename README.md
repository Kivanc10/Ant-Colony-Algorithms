# Ant Colony Algorithm

 ### Ant colony optimization (ACO) methodology is based on the ant’s capability of finding the shortest path from the nest to a food source.

  ### An ant repeatedly hops from one location to another to ultimately reach the destination (food). Each arc (i, j) of the graph G = (N, A) has an associated variable τij called the pheromone trail.

 ### Ants deposit an organic compound called pheromones while tracing a path.

  ### The intensity of the pheromone is an indicator of the utility of that arc to build better solutions.

  ### Using this decision policy, ants hop from the source to the destination.

  ### The pheromone level at each iteration is updated

  ### This is the process in which pheromone for certain solutions are decreased using “local” information; therefore, this step is also often referred to as local update. This step is pivotal to ensure that the ACO algorithm does not prematurely converge to a single solution

 ### This step refers to decisions made based on global information relating to the optimization problem. Note the difference between local in step 2 and global in step 3. Analog to step 2, step 3 is also often referred to as global update.

 ### The three steps highlighted above are repeated until the optimization problem has converged or is otherwise terminated via a prespecified termination condition

 ### Based on the above, it is clear that significant development and analysis work is required before ACO could be applied to the nonlinear topology optimization problems of concern.
